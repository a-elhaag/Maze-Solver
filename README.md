# Maze Solver

## Description
Maze Solver is a Python-based application designed to find the shortest path through a maze. It uses various algorithms to efficiently navigate and solve mazes of different complexities.

## Features
- Supports multiple maze-solving algorithms
  - Depth-First Search (DFS)
  - Breadth-First Search (BFS)
  - A* Search
- Visual representation of the maze and the solving process
- Customizable maze size and complexity

## Installation
To run the Maze Solver, you need to have Python installed on your machine. Follow these steps to get started:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/a-elhaag/Maze-Solver.git
   cd Maze-Solver
   ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```sh
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
To solve a maze, run the following command:

```sh
python main.py
```

You can customize the maze size and algorithm by editing the configuration in `config.py`.
